# Project Resonance Wave 8 - Scanning Android Apps

> Blog: https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/the-current-state-of-security-privacy-and-attack-surface-on-android-scanning-apps-for-secrets-and-more-wave-8.html

As a part of Wave 8, we are releasing the dataset containing all the apps that we scanned in a detailed JSON file which lists the app name, package name, app category, downloads, whether or not the app is free, developer ID, developer website and email as well as a dataset containing all the unique permissions that we were able to extract from the AndroidManifest.xml files.

Datasets:
- [App List](apps.json)
- [Unique Permissions List](permissions.txt)
